It's implementing a sorting algorithm for two stacks, stack A and stack B.
It includes functions for various operations on the stacks, such as pushing elements, rotating,
reversing rotations, and swapping elements.

Here's a breakdown of the functions and their purposes:

    get_place:
Assigns a place (position) to each element in a stack from top to bottom in ascending order.
This is used to calculate the cost of moving a certain number to a certain position.

    get_min_index:
Gets the current position of the element with the lowest index within a stack.

    find_smaller_index:
Picks the best target position in stack A for a given index of an element in stack B.
It checks if the index of the B element can be placed somewhere between elements in stack A,
and if not, it finds the element with the smallest index in A as the target position.

    find_final_place:
Assigns a target position in stack A to each element of stack B based on the element's index.

    push:
Pushes the top element from one stack to the top of another stack.

    pa and pb:
Pushes the top element of stack B to stack A and vice versa.

    reverse_rotate:
Brings the bottom element of a stack to the top.

    rra, rrb, and rrr:
Perform reverse rotations on stack A, stack B, or both.

    rotate:
Sends the top element of the stack to the bottom.

    ra, rb, and rr:
Perform rotations on stack A, stack B, or both.

    get_big_index:
Returns the maximum index in a stack.

    small_sort:
Sorts a stack of 3 numbers in 2 or fewer moves based on indexes.

    keep_last_3:
Pushes all elements of stack A into stack B, except the last three.

    organize_stack:
Shifts stack A until the lowest value is at the top.

    sort:
Sorting algorithm for a stack larger than 3. Pushes elements to stack B, sorts the remaining elements
in stack A, calculates the most cost-effective move, and shifts elements until stack A is sorted.

    get_last_value and get_penultimate:
Retrieve the last and second-to-last elements of a stack, respectively.

    create_new_stack:
Creates a new stack element with a given value.

    add_at_the_end:
Adds an element to the bottom of a stack.

    stack_size:
Returns the number of elements in a stack.

    swap:
Swaps the top two elements of a stack.
